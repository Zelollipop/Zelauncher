- **[Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOy1BmeXBs8)**

Follow these simple steps to install and configure Zelauncher:

1. **Download the executable file:**
   - Begin by downloading `Zelauncher.exe` from the release section.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - When you run Zelauncher for the first time, it will guide you through a setup process where you need to specify several paths:
   
     - **Local Save Directory:**
       - Default: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Annapurna Interactive\Journey\Steam`
       - Replace `username` with your actual Windows user name.
       - If you do not see the `AppData` directory, in your File explorer click `View` and check the box `Hidden items`
     
     - **Steam Save Directory:**
       - Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\steamid\638230\remote`
       - Replace `steamid` with your actual Steam ID.
     
     - **Steam Journey.url Shortcut Location:**
       - Generally located on the Desktop.
       - If you don't have a shortcut you can either create one or link to the game .exe directly.

## Additional Features

- **Customize Save Paths:**
  - You can modify individual directory paths as needed through the `Change saves path` button.
  
- **Multiple Steam Accounts:**
  - If you wish to add a save path from a second Steam account, you can configure that through the `Add second account` button.
  
- **Save File Management:**
  - Access and manage your `.BIN` save files directly through the `Saves directory` button if you need to make manual changes. (careful not to rename directories name)

## Getting Started

Once you have completed the setup and configuration, simply choose your settings from the main interface and it will then start the game with the chosen save file. Enjoy a tailored gaming experience with Zelauncher!
